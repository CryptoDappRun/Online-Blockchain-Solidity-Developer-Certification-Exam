Exam 10: Solidity Modifiers and Best Practices

Q1: What is a modifier in Solidity?
a) A contract for
b) A type of data structure
c) A reusable piece of code
d) A keyword used for loops

Answer: c) A reusable piece of code

Explanation: A modifier in Solidity is a reusable piece of code that can be applied to multiple functions to modify their behavior. Modifiers are commonly used to enforce access control, validate inputs, or add additional checks before executing a function.

Q2: How do you use a modifier in a function?
a) function modifierName()
b) use modifier modifierName
c) modifierName; function
d) function; modifierName;

Answer: d) function; modifierName;

Explanation: To use a modifier in a function, you place its name before the function definition, separated by the "modifier" keyword. For example:

modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner.");
    _;
}

function doSomething() public onlyOwner {
    // Function logic for the owner only
}
Q3: What is the purpose of the "onlyOwner" modifier in Solidity?
a) To restrict access to a specific function
b) To prevent data overflow
c) To verify the transaction sender's address
d) To add security to a contract

Answer: a) To restrict access to a specific function

Explanation: The "onlyOwner" modifier is a common use case in Solidity to restrict access to specific functions so that only the contract owner can execute them. It is often used to control administrative functions and ensure that critical operations can only be performed by the contract owner.

Q4: How do you define a custom modifier in Solidity?
a) modifier modifierName()
b) custom modifier modifierName
c) function modifierName()
d) modifierName()

Answer: a) modifier modifierName()

Explanation: To define a custom modifier in Solidity, you use the "modifier" keyword followed by the modifier's name and any conditions or checks. For example:


modifier onlyPositive(uint number) {
    require(number > 0, "Number must be positive.");
    _;
}

function doSomething(uint value) public onlyPositive(value) {
    // Function logic for positive values only
}
Q5: What is the purpose of the "view" modifier in a function?
a) It modifies the contract state.
b) It returns a value.
c) It requires Ether.
d) It is not part of Solidity.

Answer: b) It returns a value.

Explanation: The "view" modifier is used in Solidity to indicate that a function is read-only and does not modify the contract's state. It means that the function only reads data from the blockchain and does not perform any write operations.

Q6: What does the "pure" modifier indicate in a function?
a) It modifies the contract state.
b) It returns a value.
c) It requires Ether.
d) It restricts function access.

Answer: b) It returns a value.

Explanation: The "pure" modifier in Solidity indicates that a function is read-only and does not access the contract's state or storage. It is typically used for functions that perform computations and return results without any external interactions.

Q7: What is a common use of the "onlyOwner" modifier in Solidity?
a) To deploy contracts
b) To restrict access to specific functions
c) To handle unexpected events
d) To handle user input errors

Answer: b) To restrict access to specific functions

Explanation: As mentioned earlier, the "onlyOwner" modifier is commonly used to restrict access to specific functions, ensuring that only the contract owner can execute them. This adds an extra layer of security and control over critical contract functions.

Q8: How do you prevent a contract function from modifying the state?
a) Use the "stateless" keyword.
b) Use the "view" modifier.
c) Use the "pure" modifier.
d) Use the "restrictState" keyword.

Answer: c) Use the "pure" modifier.

Explanation: To prevent a contract function from modifying the state, you can use the "pure" modifier. This modifier ensures that the function is read-only and does not access the contract's state or storage. It is commonly used for utility functions that perform calculations without any side effects.

Q9: What is the purpose of the "fallback" function in Solidity?
a) It allows a contract to perform some computation.
b) It destroys the contract.
c) It transfers Ether to the contract.
d) It transfers control to the contract.

Answer: c) It transfers Ether to the contract.

Explanation: The "fallback" function in Solidity is used to receive Ether when a contract receives a transaction without matching any function. It is typically used to handle incoming Ether transfers and execute custom logic when no specific function is called.

Q10: What is a best practice for handling Ether in Solidity?
a) Avoid using the "payable" keyword.
b) Always use the "transfer" method.
c) Use the "fallback" function.
d) Use the "assert" statement.

Answer: b) Always use the "transfer" method.

Explanation: A best practice for handling Ether in Solidity is to always use the "transfer" method when sending Ether to external addresses. The "transfer" method handles the transfer of Ether and automatically reverts the transaction if the transfer fails, protecting against potential re-entrancy attacks.
